UPDATE: 11-OCT-2019 

In this update, I have included code in the code/processing_code/processingscipt.R file. This code wrangles and tidies the environmental, bacterial, and aerosol data used for this study. I have also included some exploratory data analysis, examining relationships between the Vibrio counts and environmental variables.
