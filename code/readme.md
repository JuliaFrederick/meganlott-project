In this folder, I will include the scripts required to analyze this environmental data. 

The scripts should load the appropriate data (e.g. raw or processed), perform actions, and save results (e.g. processed data, figures, computed values) in the appropriate folders. Document somewhere what inputs each script takes and where output is placed. 

If scripts need to be run in a specific order, document this. Either as comments in the script, or in a separate text file such as this. Ideally of course in both locations.

Depending on your specific project, you might want to have further sub-folders.
