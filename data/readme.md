In this folder, I will place the data set used for this analysis. 

This data should include the following information: 
1. Weekly quantification of Vibrio bacteria collected from Florida's Indian River Lagoon between June 5, 2019 and July 30, 2019
2. Environmental data collected at the time of sampling (i.e. water quality data, pH, temp, salinity)
3. Environmental data from outside sources, including aerosol composition.
