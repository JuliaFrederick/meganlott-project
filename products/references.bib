abstract = {The brevetoxin-producing dinoflagellate, Karenia brevis, forms nearly annual blooms off the Florida west coast, severely impacting the region's ecology and economy. Bacteria are often cited as either promoting or interfering with the development of algal blooms, and thus a detailed study of the bacterioplankton assemblages associated with K. brevis was undertaken. We developed sixteen 16S rRNA gene clone libraries from K. brevis bloom and adjacent nonbloom water to determine the bacterial groups present and assess the influence of K. brevis cell number and/or depth on bacterioplankton community composition. Most notably, bacterial groups such as Rhodobacterales (Alphaproteobacteria) and Cytophagales/Sphingobacteriales (Bacteroidetes), reported previously to be associated with other harmful algal species, were often abundant in the presence of K. brevis. Cyanobacteria frequently dominated surface samples containing no detectable K. brevis, consistent with earlier work suggesting that these photosynthetic organisms may be important in promoting the proliferation of these blooms by conditioning the water. Moreover, differences in the abundance/diversity of traditionally more rare and often undocumented phylogenetic groups (e.g. Betaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Chloroflexus, Firmicutes) were apparent in bloom vs. nonbloom water. This is the first study to document the association of these phylogenetic groups with natural K. brevis populations and suggests a potential role for these microorganisms in K. brevis bloom dynamics.},

abstract = {Vibrio are an abundant and diverse group of bacteria that form associations with phytoplankton. Correlations between Vibrio and phytoplankton abundance have been noted, suggesting that growth is enhanced during algal blooms or that association with phytoplankton provides a refuge from predation. Here, we investigated relationships between particle-associated Vibrio and phytoplankton in Delaware's Inland Bays (DIB). The relative abundances of particle-associated Vibrio and algal classes that form blooms in the DIB (dinoflagellates, diatoms and raphidophytes) were determined using quantitative PCR. Results demonstrated a significant correlation between particle-associated Vibrio abundance and phytoplankton, with higher correlations to diatoms and raphidophytes compared to dinoflagellates. Species-specific associations were examined during a mixed bloom of Heterosigma akashiwo and Fibrocapsa japonica (Raphidophyceae), and indicated a significant positive correlation for particle-associated Vibrio abundance with H. akashiwo but a negative correlation with F. japonica. Changes in Vibrio assemblages during the bloom were evaluated using automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA), which revealed significant differences between each size fraction, but no significant change in Vibrio assemblages over the course of the bloom. Microzooplankton grazing experiments showed that losses of particle-associated Vibrio may be offset by increased growth in the Vibrio population. Moreover, analysis of Vibrio assemblages by ARISA also indicated an increase in the relative abundance for specific members of the Vibrio community despite higher grazing pressure on the particle-associated population as a whole. Results of this investigation demonstrate links between phytoplankton and Vibrio that may lead to predictions of potential health risks and inform future management practices in this region.},

abstract = {Extensive sampling and metagenomics analyses of plankton communities across all aquatic environments are beginning to provide insights into the ecology of microbial communities. In particular, the importance of metabolic exchanges that provide a foundation for ecological interactions between microorganisms has emerged as a key factor in forging such communities. Here we show how both studies of environmental samples and physiological experimentation in the laboratory with defined microbial co-cultures are being used to decipher the metabolic and molecular underpinnings of such exchanges. In addition, we explain how metabolic modelling may be used to conduct investigations in reverse, deducing novel molecular exchanges from analysis of large-scale data sets, which can identify persistently co-occurring species. Finally, we consider how knowledge of microbial community ecology can be built into evolutionary theories tailored to these species' unique lifestyles. We propose a novel model for the evolution of metabolic auxotrophy in microorganisms that arises as a result of symbiosis, termed the Foraging-to-Farming hypothesis. The model has testable predictions, fits several known examples of mutualism in the aquatic world, and sheds light on how interactions, which cement dependencies within communities of microorganisms, might be initiated.},

abstract = {In response to a major influx of freshwater to the Mississippi Sound following the opening of the Bonnet Carre Spillway, water samples were collected from three sites along the Mississippi shoreline to assess the impact of altered salinity on three pathogenic Vibrio species. Salinity readings across the affected area during the 2011 sample period ranged from 1.4 to 12.9 ppt (mean = 7.0) and for the 2012 sample period from 14.1 to 23.6 ppt (mean = 19.8). Analyses of the data collected in 2011 showed a reduction in densities of Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus with a concurrent increase of Vibrio cholerae numbers, with V. cholerae becoming the only Vibrio detected once salinity readings dropped to 6 ppt. Follow-up samples taken in 2012 after recovery of the salinity in the sound showed that the relative densities of the three pathogenic vibrios had reverted back to normal levels. This study shows that although the spillway was open but a few weeks and the effects were therefore time limited, the Mississippi River water had a profound, if temporary, effect on Vibrio ecology in the Mississippi Sound.},

abstract = {Interactions between microorganisms and algae during bloom events significantly impacts their physiology, alters ambient chemistry, and shapes ecosystem diversity. The potential role these interactions have in bloom development and decline are also of particular interest given the ecosystem impacts of algal blooms. We hypothesized that microbial community structure and succession is linked to specific bloom stages, and reflects complex interactions among taxa comprising the phycosphere environment. This investigation used pyrosequencing and correlation approaches to assess patterns and associations among bacteria, archaea, and microeukaryotes during a spring bloom of the dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella. Within the bacterial community, Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were predominant during the initial bloom stage, while Alphaproteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, and Actinobacteria were the most abundant taxa present during bloom onset and termination. In the archaea biosphere, methanogenic members were present during the early bloom period while the majority of species identified in the late bloom stage were ammonia-oxidizing archaea and Halobacteriales. Dinoflagellates were the major eukaryotic group present during most stages of the bloom, whereas a mixed assemblage comprising diatoms, green-algae, rotifera, and other microzooplankton were present during bloom termination. Temperature and salinity were key environmental factors associated with changes in bacterial and archaeal community structure, respectively, whereas inorganic nitrogen and inorganic phosphate were associated with eukaryotic variation. The relative contribution of environmental parameters measured during the bloom to variability among samples was 35.3{\%}. Interaction analysis showed that Maxillopoda, Spirotrichea, Dinoflagellata, and Halobacteria were keystone taxa within the positive-correlation network, while Halobacteria, Dictyochophyceae, Mamiellophyceae, and Gammaproteobacteria were the main contributors to the negative-correlation network. The positive and negative relationships were the primary drivers of mutualist and competitive interactions that impacted algal bloom fate, respectively. Functional predictions showed that blooms enhance microbial carbohydrate and energy metabolism, and alter the sulfur cycle. Our results suggest that microbial community structure is strongly linked to bloom progression, although specific drivers of community interactions and responses are not well understood. The importance of considering biotic interactions (e.g., competition, symbiosis, and predation) when investigating the link between microbial ecological behavior and an algal bloom's trajectory is also highlighted.},

@article{Phlips2002,
abstract = {Phytoplankton dynamics in the Indian River Lagoon was examined from the point of view of several key controlling factors, including: nutrient limitation, light availability, temperature, wind, hydrodynamic restriction and grazing. Water was collected at eight sampling sites in the lagoon on a monthly basis for a two and a half year period. Samples were analysed for nutrient content and phytoplankton abundance. Site measurements of salinity and light extinction were made at all sites. Regional data on rainfall, wind and water temperature was obtained for correlation analyses. Bioassays were performed to determine nutrient limiting status and a series of preliminary grazing experiments were carried out on selected samples. The results indicate that the Indian River Lagoon is a nutrient-rich environment where phytoplankton standing crops are often held below their potential by several key loss functions, including hydraulic flushing and grazing. Spatial patterns of phytoplankton abundance generally reflected the degree of restriction to water turnover in different regions of the lagoon, with higher mean abundances in restricted regions. Spatial and temporal patterns of nutrient content and limitation suggest that patterns of external nutrient loading also play a significant role in phytoplankton dynamics. High phosphorus levels in the southern portion of the lagoon contribute to the predominance of nitrogen limitation in the region. In contrast, relatively high N/P ratios in the northern portions of the lagoon contribute to greater potential for phosphorus limitation of phytoplankton growth. As might be expected from the subtropical location of the lagoon, temporal patterns of phytoplankton abundance appear to be less strictly dependent on season than in temperate habitats, and more closely linked to variations in weather conditions, like rainfall (including storm events). The latter considerations bring into play issues like temporal variation in salinity and wind-induced mixing. The high light flux and shallow depth in the lagoon also presents the potential for photoinhibition.},

Thus, certain al-gicidal bacteria have been proposed for the control of red tides. Meanwhile, many red tide organisms are known to feed on marine bacteria. The roles of marine bacteria and red tide organisms are therefore reversible. In Korean waters, the killing of red tide organisms by algicidal bacteria, and also the feeding of red tide organisms on marine bacteria have been extensively investigated. The findings of such studies may influence the conventional view of red tide dynamics, and also planktonic food webs. Here, we review the species and concentrations of algicidal bacteria that kill red tide organisms in Korean waters, as well as the ingestion rate and grazing impact of red tide organisms on marine bacteria. Furthermore, we offer an insight into the ecological roles of these 2 components in marine planktonic food webs.},

abstract = {Photosynthetic picoeukaryotes are significant contributors to marine primary productivity. Associations between marine bacterioplankton and picoeukaryotes frequently occur and can have large biogeochemical impacts. We used flow cytometry to sort cells from seawater to identify non-eukaryotic phylotypes that are associated with photosynthetic picoeukaryotes. Samples were collected at the Santa Cruz wharf on Monterey Bay, California during summer and fall, 2014. The phylogeny of associated microbes was assessed through 16S rRNA gene amplicon clone and Illumina MiSeq libraries. The most frequently detected bacterioplankton phyla within the photosynthetic picoeukaryote sorts were Proteobacteria (Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria) and Bacteroidetes. Intriguingly, the presence of free-living bacterial genera in the photosynthetic picoeukaryote sorts could suggest that some of the photosynthetic picoeukaryotes were mixotrophs. However, the occurrence of bacterial sequences, which were not prevalent in the corresponding bulk seawater samples, indicates that there was also a selection for specific OTUs in association with photosynthetic picoeukaryotes suggesting specific functional associations. The results show that diverse bacterial phylotypes are found in association with photosynthetic picoeukaryotes. Taxonomic identification of these associations is a prerequisite for further characterizing and to elucidate their metabolic pathways and ecological functions.},

We used desferrioxamine B (DFB) to study the siderophore effect on cultures of Skeletonema costatum and Alexandrium catenella. The experimental approach used semi-continuous additions of iron(II) and DFB over time, reaching final concentrations of 1 and 10 nM Fe and 10-10000 nM DFB. The negative effect of DFB over growth in S. costatum was evident and sharp until day 9 for treatments above 500 nM. Delayed growth occurred at 10000 nM, reaching {\~{}} 80 {\%} of cell density in Controls under both iron conditions. A. catenella exhibited a more attenuated negative effect of DFB over growth, only significant at 10000 nM, while growth was enhanced at lowest DFB. Total bacterial abundance in diatom and dinoflagellate cultures presented inversed trends. While negatively correlated to DFB in diatom cultures, bacteria in high DFB treatments in dinoflagellate cultures reached highest abundances. Delayed growth exhibited in S. costatum at the highest DFB, indicates favorable changes for Fe uptake occurred over time, suggesting involvement of other mechanism facilitating the diatom cell membrane reduction. Overall unaffected growth in A. catenella suggests the potential to utilize FeDFB and therefore capacity to access strongly complexed Fe sources. Contrasting responses in the bacterial community associated with each species, highlight the complexity of these interactions, while suggest that for A. catenella it may represent an advantage for acquiring Fe. The DFB effect exhibited the capacity for different uptake strategies among phytoplankton species of different functional groups and underlines the necessity to broaden the study of iron bioavailability on a species basis, alongside interaction with other microbial components such bacteria, to reflect interactions in natural ecosystems.},

abstract = {a r t i c l e i n f o Algae and bacteria have coexisted ever since the early stages of evolution. This coevolution has revolutionized life on earth in many aspects. Algae and bacteria together influence ecosystems as varied as deep seas to lichens and represent all conceivable modes of interactions-from mutualism to parasitism. Several studies have shown that algae and bacteria synergistically affect each other's physiology and metabolism, a classic case being algae-roseobacter interaction. These interactions are ubiquitous and define the primary productivity in most ecosystems. In recent years, algae have received much attention for industrial exploitation but their interaction with bacteria is often considered a contamination during commercialization. A few recent studies have shown that bacteria not only enhance algal growth but also help in flocculation, both essential processes in algal biotechnology. Hence, there is a need to understand these interactions from an evolutionary and ecological standpoint, and integrate this understanding for industrial use. Here we reflect on the diversity of such relationships and their associated mechanisms, as well as the habitats that they mutually influence. This review also outlines the role of these interactions in key evolutionary events such as endosymbiosis, besides their ecological role in biogeochem-ical cycles. Finally, we focus on extending such studies on algal-bacterial interactions to various environmental and biotechnological applications.},

abstract = {Phytoplankton blooms exhibit a severe impact on bacterioplankton communities as they change nutrient availabilities and other environmental factors. In the current study, the response of a bacterioplankton community to a Phaeocystis globosa spring bloom was investigated in the southern North Sea. For this purpose, water samples were taken inside and reference samples outside of an algal spring bloom. Structural changes of the bacterioplankton community were assessed by amplicon-based analysis of 16S rRNA genes and transcripts generated from environmental DNA and RNA, respectively. Several marine groups responded to bloom presence. The abundance of the Roseobacter RCA cluster and the SAR92 clade significantly increased in bloom presence in the total and active fraction of the bacterial community. Functional changes were investigated by direct sequencing of environmental DNA and mRNA. The corresponding datasets comprised more than 500 million sequences across all samples. Metatranscriptomic data sets were mapped on representative genomes of abundant marine groups present in the samples and on assembled metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets. Differences in gene expression profiles between non-bloom and bloom samples were recorded. The genome-wide gene expression level of Planktomarina temperata, an abundant member of the Roseobacter RCA cluster, was higher inside the bloom. Genes that were differently expressed},

abstract = {The bacteria associated with oceanic algal blooms are acknowledged to play important roles in carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycling, yet little information is available on their identities or phylogenetic affiliations. Three culture-independent methods were used to characterize bacteria from a dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP)-producing algal bloom in the North Atlantic. Group-specific 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotides, 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) clone libraries, and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis all indicated that the marine Roseobacter lineage was numerically important in the heterotrophic bacterial community , averaging {\textgreater}20{\%} of the 16S rDNA sampled. Two other groups of heterotrophic bacteria, the SAR86 and SAR11 clades, were also shown by the three 16S rRNA-based methods to be abundant in the bloom community. In surface waters, the Roseobacter, SAR86, and SAR11 lineages together accounted for over 50{\%} of the bacterial rDNA and showed little spatial variability in abundance despite variations in the dominant algal species. Depth profiles indicated that Roseobacter phylotype abundance decreased with depth and was positively correlated with chlorophyll a, DMSP, and total organic sulfur (dimethyl sulfide plus DMSP plus dimethyl sulfoxide) concentrations. Based on these data and previous physiological studies of cultured Roseobacter strains, we hypothesize that this lineage plays a role in cycling organic sulfur compounds produced within the bloom. Three other abundant bacterial phylotypes (representing a cyanobacterium and two members of the Proteobacteria) were primarily associated with chlorophyll-rich surface waters of the bloom (0 to 50 m), while two others (representing Cytophagales and Proteobacteria) were primarily found in deeper waters (200 to 500 m). The bacterial communities associated with oceanic algal blooms play critical roles in carbon and nitrogen cycling through their influence on the formation and fate of dissolved organic matter (4, 7), nutrient availability (24), sinking flux (45), and many other processes. In blooms dominated by algal species that produce dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DSMP), bloom-associated bacteria also play an important role in organic sulfur cycling. Degradation of DMSP by marine bacteria is one of the primary routes for the formation of dimethyl sulfide (DMS), a volatile sulfur compound that influences global climate through effects on backscatter and cloud formation (6). Recent studies have suggested that marine bacteria may control DMS formation through the expression of a competing pathway that routes the sulfur in DMSP through meth-anethiol (MeSH) rather than to DMS (21, 27, 46). New evidence is pointing to one particular lineage of marine bacteria as a key participant in DMSP biogeochemistry in the ocean. Both culture-independent (i.e., 16S rRNA-based) and culture-dependent studies indicate that members of the Pro-teobacteria belonging to the Roseobacter lineage are abundant in coastal and open-ocean environments (15, 17, 18), where they are often found in association with marine algae (2, 3, 25, 35, 38, 47). In contrast to other dominant marine bacterial clades which have no close relatives in culture (15), members of the Roseobacter group are readily cultured and have yielded important information about the sulfur physiology of this lin-eage (18, 23). Laboratory studies of Roseobacter isolates show a widespread ability to degrade DMSP and to mediate various other transformations of organic and inorganic sulfur compounds (18, 23, 28). Roseobacter isolates express both the DMS-producing pathway and the MeSH-producing pathway during DMSP degradation (18), although the regulation of these two competing pathways is not yet understood. The Ro-seobacter group also harbors the only known cultured bacteria that are able to incorporate DMSP sulfur into cellular proteins (via MeSH), an important fate of reduced sulfur in DMSP that may be regulated by bacterial sulfur demand (22, 23, 40). Relatively little is known of the identities of the other bacterial groups that may be active in DMSP-producing algal blooms. Recently, Kerkhof et al. (20) identified bacterial 16S rRNA sequences unique to a coastal bloom, including members of the Roseobacter group and the and $\epsilon$ subdivisions of Proteobacteria, although it is not clear whether DMSP was produced during this bloom. Riemann et al. (38) report that heterotrophic bacteria associated with induced diatom blooms (which typically do not produce DMSP) were dominated by Roseobacter and Cytophagales 16S rRNA gene sequences. We report here a comprehensive inventory of the dominant heterotrophic bacterioplankton associated with a spatially complex DMSP-producing algal bloom in the North Atlantic. The bloom consisted of a cold core of an eddy dominated by the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi and surrounding waters characterized by a mixed phytoplankton assemblage dominated by dinoflagellates and small flagellates.

abstract = {Particle-associated bacteria (PAB) and free-living bacteria (FLB) from aquatic environments during phytoplankton blooms differ in their physical distance from algae. Both the interactions within PAB and FLB community fractions and their relationship with the surrounding environmental properties are largely unknown. Here, by using high-throughput sequencing and network-based analyses, we compared the community and network characteristics of PAB and FLB from a plateau lake during a Microcystis aeruginosa bloom. Results showed that PAB and FLB differed significantly in diversity, structure and microbial connecting network. PAB communities were characterized by highly similar bacterial community structure in different sites, tighter network connections, important topological roles for the bloom-causing M. aeruginosa and Alphaproteobacteria, especially for the potentially nitrogen-fixing (Pleomorphomonas) and algicidal bacteria (Brevundimonas sp.). FLB communities were sensitive to the detected environmental factors and were characterized by significantly higher bacterial diversity, less connectivity, larger network size and marginal role of M. aeruginosa. In both networks, covariation among bacterial taxa was extensive ({\textgreater} 88{\%} positive connections), and bacteria potentially affiliated with biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen (i.e. denitrification, nitrogen-fixation and nitrite-oxidization) were important in occupying module hubs, such as Meganema, Pleomorphomonas and Nitrospira. These findings highlight the importance of considering microbial network interactions for the understanding of blooms.},

abstract = {Microalgae undertake a wide range of mutualistic interactions with bacteria. Here we consider how transcriptomic, metagenomic and metabolomic approaches have been combined with microbiological and biochemical analyses to expand our understanding of algal-bacterial interactions. Identification of the major bacterial species associated with algae indicates that specific bacterial groups, particularly the alpha-Proteobacteria, are found more frequently, suggesting that these may have the means to initiate and maintain symbiotic relationships. Nutrient exchange is frequently the basis of algal-bacterial mutualism, and as the compounds involved are characterised, evidence is accumulating that these are complex and specific molecules, offering opportunities for signalling processes and regulation rather than merely passive diffusion. At the same time, it is clear that the interactions are not static, but can be initiated and broken in response to environmental and developmental cues.},

abstract = {Marine microalgae support world fisheries production and influence climate through various mechanisms. They are also responsible for harmful blooms that adversely impact coastal ecosystems and economies. Optimal growth and survival of many bloom-forming microalgae, including climatically important dinoflagellates and coccolithophores, requires the close association of specific bacterial species, but the reasons for these associations are unknown. Here, we report that several clades of Marinobacter ubiquitously found in close association with dinoflagellates and coccolithophores produce an unusual lower-affinity dicitrate siderophore, vibrioferrin (VF). Fe-VF chelates undergo photolysis at rates that are 10-20 times higher than siderophores produced by free-living marine bacteria, and unlike the latter, the VF photoproduct has no measurable affinity for iron. While both an algal-associated bacterium and a representative dinoflagellate partner, Scrippsiella trochoidea, used iron from Fe-VF chelates in the dark, in situ photolysis of the chelates in the presence of attenuated sunlight increased bacterial iron uptake by 70{\%} and algal uptake by {\textgreater}20-fold. These results suggest that the bacteria promote algal assimilation of iron by facilitating photochemical redox cycling of this critical nutrient. Also, binary culture experiments and genomic evidence suggest that the algal cells release organic molecules that are used by the bacteria for growth. Such mutualistic sharing of iron and fixed carbon has important implications toward our understanding of the close beneficial interactions between marine bacteria and phytoplankton, and the effect of these interactions on algal blooms and climate.},

abstract = {The canonical Redfield C:N:P ratio for algal biomass is often not achieved in inland waters due to higher C and N content and more variability when compared to the oceans. This has been attributed to much lower residence times and higher contributions of the watershed to the total organic matter pool of continental ecosystems. In this study we examined the effect of water residence times in low latitude lakes (in a gradient from humid to a semi-arid region) on seston elemental ratios in different size fractions. We used lake water specific conductivity as a proxy for residence time in a region of Eastern Brazil where there is a strong precipitation gradient. The C:P ratios decreased in the seston and bacterial size-fractions and increased in the dissolved fraction with increasing water retention time, suggesting uptake of N and P from the dissolved pool. Bacterial abundance, production and respiration increased in response to increased residence time and intracellular nutrient availability in agreement with the growth rate hypothesis. Our results reinforce the role of microorganisms in shaping the chemical environment in aquatic systems particularly at long water residence times and highlights the importance of this factor in influencing ecological stoichiometry in all aquatic ecosystems.},
